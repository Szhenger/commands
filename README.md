# Commands
#### Description:
At the command-line interface, writing and executing code becomes more time-efficient; however, the commands that enable these workflows are specific to the operating system upon which the machine is running. For instance, the Linux and Mac Operating Systems have much overlap with respect to command names (since both are based upon the Unix Operating System); however, the Window Operating System differ in many command names such as ls (list) for Mac and Linux and dir (list) for Windows. Therefore, many commands native to the Mac, Windows, and Linux Operating Systems are implemented here as C files to obtain the functionality of these commands regardless of operating systems.
